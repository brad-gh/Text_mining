This work aims to implement a sentiment analysis algorithm of movies' critiques. 
The algorithm used is the Naive Bayes. The algorithm is implemented in Python.
The NLTK pachage is also used to pre-process the text data. 

All sources used to understand the Naive Bayes algorithm are specified in the notebook. 

Cheers :)
